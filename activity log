8-9am: research on how to manipulate 3D perspective with CSS
9-10am: still looking at manipulating perspective, and figuring how I'll do object modeling
10-11am: just found a cool webapp that seems like it'll let me make 3D models with html elements (i think?) testing it out! tridiv.com
11-12: getting tridiv 3d model to display in project
12-1: lunch!
1-2: trying to understand why the models from tridiv aren't importing correctly. might be something to do with position attribute?
