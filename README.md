## üåê About the Project     
<br><br/>
### üìñ Description
 _I made this application to explore what's possible with 3D transformations of HTML elements using CSS. My idea was to create a simple 3d scene rendered 100% with HTML elements, transformed by a CSS stylesheet. There are multiple javascript libraries that specialize in 3D modeling and animation such as three.js, and if I were to make something like this commercially, I wouldn't hesitate to use one of those libraries. Using a library would have made the project MUCH easier and the final results would have been better IMO. My goal here was to push the limits of CSS and take it places it wasn't necessarily designed to go. For funsies. [Live GH-Pages Deployment](https://cruduper.github.io/Synthwave-3D-CSS-Engine/)_

#### _**! IMPORTANT !** -- In order to run this **you will likely need to have a semi-modern GPU installed on your machine**. It is unlikely to run at a usable framerate using onboard graphics. **Google Chrome is the preffered browser** to run this application at this time. In some other browsers I tested, the app ran anywhere from slow to unusably slow and the intro animations executed incorrectly. I created an "Eco" mode that uses fewer resources and runs slightly faster (see Controls). I plan on optimizing performance both generally and for specific browsers at a later date._       
<br><br/> 

### üéÆ Controls
```
Turn Left: left Arrow key
Turn Right: Right Arrow key
Boost: Up Arrow key
Camera Angle Change: 'C' key
Developer Mode: 'D' key
"Eco" Mode toggle: 'E' key
```

### ü¶† Known Bugs OR Issues

1. Palm trees change position during boost (generalized, animations change/reset if animation speed or other variables change). This may be due to CSS doing the calculations for any transition from one value to another only once (at very start of the animation). If this is the case, fixing it might be impossible with CSS, but the problem could be alleviated using a javascript library to do my animations, such as Greensock (https://greensock.com/gsap/) or Velocity (http://velocityjs.org/). But that is beyond the scope of the project. I will need to investigate this bug more fully to see if anything can be done.

2. Red glowyness still suddenly appears on car during "Eco" mode during "boost" animation, making it look like the car changes color slightly. This needs to be fixed, but I still might want white glow to happen on tires during "Eco" mode. 

3. When the user pressed the left key immediately followed by the right key with very fast timing, the cars turning speed is doubled. 

4. Many parts of the code need refactoring. 

5. More CSS variables should be made to keep the code DRY. 

6. Intro animations look wrong in some non-chrome browsers

7. Timing of intro animations is off in some non-chrome browsers.
